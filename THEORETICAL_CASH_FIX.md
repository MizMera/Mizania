# 🔧 Fixed: Theoretical Cash Now Shows Correct 41.7 DT

## 🚨 **The Problem You Identified**

You're absolutely correct! The theoretical cash should show **41.7 DT** to match the physical cash you have.

**What was happening:**
- ✅ Physical cash: 41.7 DT (correct)
- ✅ Opening fund: 41.7 DT (correct)  
- ❌ Theoretical cash: 0.00 DT (WRONG!)

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

When you used "set exact amount" with 41.7 DT:
1. System calculated: 41.7 - 41.7 = 0 DT adjustment needed
2. Created opening transaction with `montant: 0.00` (adjustment amount)
3. Stored actual opening amount in `cout_total: 41.7`
4. But theoretical cash calculation only looked at `montant: 0.00` ❌

## ✅ **The Fix**

Updated the theoretical cash calculation to recognize opening funds properly:

```javascript
// For opening transactions, use the actual opening amount (cout_total) if available
const caisseIn = transactions.filter(r => getWallet(r) === 'Caisse').reduce((s, r) => {
  if (isOpeningFund(r) && r.cout_total !== undefined) {
    return s + Number(r.cout_total || 0);  // Use actual opening amount: 41.7 DT
  }
  return s + Number(r.montant || 0);       // Use transaction amount for others
}, 0);
```

## 🎯 **Result**

Now your theoretical cash will correctly show:
- **Caisse Théorique**: **41.70 DT** ✅

This matches your physical cash and opening fund, as it should!

## 🧮 **The Logic**

**Before:**
```
Theoretical Cash = Transaction amounts only
= Opening (0.00) + Sales (0.00) - Expenses (0.00) = 0.00 DT ❌
```

**After:**
```  
Theoretical Cash = Actual opening fund + Sales - Expenses
= Opening (41.70) + Sales (0.00) - Expenses (0.00) = 41.70 DT ✅
```

Perfect alignment with your physical cash! 🎉
